## **What is MacroScrapper?**

MacroScrapper is a web scrapper for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) music. It is a Python script that will download all the free music from a Bandcamp artist page, album after album, in your Music directory.

## **Where does it come from?**

![Macroblank Bandcamp banner](./images/macro-banner.png)

MacroScrapper is a project I made for my personal use. I wanted to download all the music from a Bandcamp artist page named [Macroblank](https://macroblank.bandcamp.com/). I didn't want to download the music one by one so I decided to make a script that would do it for me.
That is why the script is named MacroScrapper.

## **How does it work?**

The script will use the [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) library to open a Chrome browser. It will then navigate to the Bandcamp artist page and click on the "Download" button of each album. The script will then repeat the process for each album.

Each album will be downloaded in a separate folder. The folder will be named after the album name. The album will be downloaded in a ``.zip`` file then extracted in the folder with the same name as the album.

### **Saving data**

It will create a ``.csv`` file with the name of the artist and the name of the album. The file will contain the following information:

* Album name
* Album URL
* Album release date
* Album genre
* Album tracklist

It will also create a ``.txt`` file with the name of the artist and the name of the album. The file will contain the following information:

* Download date
* Album name
* Artist name
* Album tracklist

The project will download the music in yout Music folder. It will create a folder named MacroScrapper and then create a folder named after the artist's name. The folder will contain all the albums downloaded as zip files, the ``.csv`` and ``.txt`` files.

> Why do I want to stock data?

I wanted to keep track of the music I downloaded. I also wanted to keep track of the albums I downloaded and the date I downloaded them so I could know if I already downloaded an album or not.

I like data processing so i'd like in the future to make a script that would read the ``.csv`` file and make graphs and statistics about the music I downloaded.

### **Directory structure**

```shell
Music   
.
|___ MacroScrapper
    |___ Artist1
        |___ Album1
        |___ Album2
        |___ ...
        |___ Zips
    |___ Artist2
        |___ Album1
        |___ Album2
        |___ ...
        |___ Zips
    |___ ...
```

## How to use it?

<img src='./images/probleme.png' width=100 align=right>

This script will ask you to enter the artist name's album you want to download.
> It is planned to make a GUI for the script. For now, it is a command line script.

Just let it do the job. It will take a while depending on the number of albums the artist has.

### Installation

Python version 3.11.1 or higher is required.

* Clone the repository
* Install the requirements with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

> In future versions, I want to make a ``.exe`` file so you won't need to install Python.

### Usage

* Run the script with `python main.py`
* Enter the name of the artist in the terminal.
* Wait for the script to finish.
* Retrieve the music in your Music folder.
